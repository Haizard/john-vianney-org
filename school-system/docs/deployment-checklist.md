- [ ] Environment variables are documented in .env.example
- [ ] MongoDB connection has proper error handling and retry logic
- [ ] CORS is configured to allow requests from the frontend domain
- [ ] API routes are properly secured with authentication where needed
- [ ] No hardcoded development URLs or credentials

### Frontend

## Deployment Process

1. [ ] Push all changes to the repository
