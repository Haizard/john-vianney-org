# React Router Error #299 Debugging Framework

This debugging framework provides comprehensive tools for diagnosing and fixing React Router Error #299 ("You cannot change `<Router history>` after it has been created").

## Overview

The framework includes:

- Advanced logging and tracing utilities
- React component lifecycle monitoring
- Router initialization tracking
- React 18 integration diagnostics
- Comprehensive diagnostic reports
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Solution implementations

## Installation

To implement the debugging framework and fix Error #299:

1. Run the implementation script:
   ```
   powershell -File run-debugging-implementation.ps1
   ```

2. Start your application and verify that it works correctly:
   ```
   cd frontend/school-frontend-app
   npm start
   ```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs` directory:

- `DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide to using the debugging framework
- `ERROR_299_GUIDE.md` - Specific guide for diagnosing and fixing Error #299
- `reports/ERROR_299_DIAGNOSTIC_REPORT.md` - Detailed diagnostic report for Error #299
- `reports/ERROR_299_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide

## Solution

The framework implements a solution that:

1. Ensures correct initialization order:
   - `createRoot` is called before Router initialization
   - Router is initialized only once

2. Maintains proper component hierarchy:
   - Single Router instance at the top level
   - No nested Router components

3. Provides error handling:
   - Error boundaries catch and report Router errors
   - Detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting

## Verification

After implementation, verify that:

1. No Error #299 appears in the console
2. Navigation works correctly throughout the application
3. The application doesn't crash during navigation
4. React DevTools shows a clean component hierarchy

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after implementation:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Generate a diagnostic report using the debugging tools
3. Verify that the implementation was applied correctly
4. Consult the documentation for specific solutions
