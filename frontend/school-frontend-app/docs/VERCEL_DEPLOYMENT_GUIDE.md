# Vercel Deployment Guide with Debugging Framework

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying your application to Vercel with the debugging framework for React Router Error #299.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository connected to Vercel
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- Vercel account

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Implement the Debugging Framework for Vercel

Run the Vercel implementation script:

```
powershell -File run-vercel-implementation.ps1
```

This script will:
- Update index.js with the correct initialization pattern
- Remove any Router components from App.js
- Update vercel.json with the correct configuration
- Update package.json with the correct build script

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes

Commit and push the changes to GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Implement debugging framework for Vercel deployment"
git push
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. If you've connected your GitHub repository, Vercel will automatically detect the changes and start a new deployment
4. If not, click "Deploy" to manually trigger a deployment

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your Vercel project:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: Your JWT secret key
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`: Your JWT refresh secret key

To set environment variables:
1. Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
3. Add each variable with its value
4. Click "Save"

### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

1. Once the deployment is complete, click on the deployment URL
2. Test navigation throughout your application
3. Check the browser console for any errors
4. Verify that Error #299 does not occur

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Vercel deployment:

### Build Errors

1. Check the build logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Look for specific error messages
3. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Verify that the build script is correct

### Runtime Errors

1. Open the browser console to check for errors
2. Look for Error #299 or other Router-related errors
3. Check that the initialization pattern is correct
4. Verify that there are no nested Router components

### API Connection Issues

1. Make sure environment variables are set correctly
2. Check that API routes are configured correctly in vercel.json
3. Verify that CORS headers are set correctly
4. Test API endpoints directly

## Monitoring

To monitor your application for Router errors:

1. Open the browser console
2. Look for messages related to Router Error #299
3. Check the error boundary for any caught errors
4. Monitor Vercel logs for server-side errors

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should be able to deploy your application to Vercel with the debugging framework for React Router Error #299. The framework will help prevent the error from occurring and provide helpful error messages if it does occur.

If you continue to experience issues, refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory for more detailed information.
