# Assessment Management System Documentation

## Overview

The Assessment Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing term-based assessments, calculating weighted grades, and generating detailed reports. This document provides technical details and usage guidelines for the system.

## Features

### 1. Assessment Management

- Create, update, and delete assessments
- Configure weightage for each assessment
- Term-based organization
- Status tracking (active/inactive)
- Validation of total weightage per term

### 2. Marks Entry

- Individual student marks entry
- Bulk marks upload
- Real-time grade calculation
- Validation against maximum marks
- Historical marks tracking

### 3. Reporting

- Comprehensive assessment reports
- Grade distribution analysis
- Statistical insights
- PDF export functionality
- Custom report generation

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components

1. **Models**
   - `Assessment.js`: Core assessment schema
   - `Result.js`: Student results schema
   - `MarksHistory.js`: Historical tracking

2. **Controllers**
   - Assessment CRUD operations
   - Marks management
   - Report generation
   - Statistics calculation

3. **Middleware**
   - Authentication
   - Validation
   - Error handling

### Frontend Components

1. **Assessment Management**
   - AssessmentManagement.jsx
   - AssessmentForm.jsx
   - AssessmentList.jsx

2. **Results Management**
   - StudentResultView.jsx
   - BulkAssessmentEntry.jsx
   - ResultsTable.jsx

3. **Reporting**
   - AssessmentReport.jsx
   - GradeDistribution.jsx
   - StatisticsWidget.jsx

## API Endpoints

### Assessment Management

```
GET    /api/assessments
POST   /api/assessments
GET    /api/assessments/:id
PUT    /api/assessments/:id
DELETE /api/assessments/:id
```

### Marks Management

```
POST   /api/assessments/bulk-marks
GET    /api/assessments/:id/marks
PUT    /api/assessments/:id/marks/:studentId
```

### Reports

```
GET    /api/assessments/stats
GET    /api/assessments/report/:classId/:assessmentId

```

## Database Schema

### Assessment Schema

```javascript
{
  name: String,
  weightage: Number,
  maxMarks: Number,
  term: String,
  examDate: Date,
  status: String,
  description: String,
  createdBy: ObjectId,
  updatedBy: ObjectId
}
```

### Result Schema

```javascript
{
  studentId: ObjectId,
  assessmentId: ObjectId,
  marksObtained: Number,
  maxMarks: Number,
  grade: String,
  term: String,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Grade Calculation

Grades are calculated based on the following criteria:

```javascript
A: >= 75%
B: >= 65%
C: >= 45%
D: >= 30%
F: < 30%
```

## Weightage Rules

1. Total weightage per term must equal 100%
2. Individual assessment weightage must be between 0 and 100
3. System validates weightage distribution during assessment creation/update

## Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control

2. **Data Validation**
   - Input sanitization
   - Schema validation
   - Business rule validation

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Change tracking
   - User action logging
   - Result history maintenance

## Error Handling

1. **Validation Errors**
   - Schema validation
   - Business rule validation
   - Data consistency checks

2. **System Errors**
   - Database connection issues
   - External service failures
   - Resource constraints

## Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Controller tests
   - Model tests
   - Utility function tests

2. **Integration Tests**
   - API endpoint tests
   - Database interaction tests
   - Authentication tests

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - User flow tests
   - UI interaction tests
   - Report generation tests

## Performance Considerations

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Proper indexing
   - Query optimization
   - Batch operations

2. **Caching**
   - Report caching
   - Statistics caching
   - Assessment data caching

## Deployment
